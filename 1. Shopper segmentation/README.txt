For this project, data scientist ran a k-mean clustering analysis for iShopChangi shoppers who shopped between June 2020 and May 2021.
Data used for the clustering exercise includes net spend, products categories bought, frequency and number of visits and etc.

I took over the segmented/clustered data and find out the characteristics of each segment:
1. Spent on product categories
2. Proportion of Changi Rewards Tier
3. Net spend per order
4. Frequency of purchase
5. Recency of purchase
6. Size of shopping cart
7. Price sensitivity
8. Age of shoppers
9. Proportion of discounted transactions
10. Proportion of subscription opt-in
11. Gender of segment population
12. Gross spend of subscription opt-in vs. opt-out
